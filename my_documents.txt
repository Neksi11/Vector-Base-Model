Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.
Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language.
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.
Big data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information.
